Bio
I am a self-proclaimed “geek”.  On more than a few occasions I know the answers to odd computer problems. I am the co-worker that bosses and professionals alike come to first for answers to many computer issues. I love to work through problems in a logical manner and will often come up with unique solutions. I am detail oriented and love working with data in a variety of ways from raw numbers to “pretty” charts. I would love to bring these qualities to your team and company.

Good day!
What excites me? The opportunity to solve problems, improve systems, resourcefully create solutions and systems that work, build processes that everyone can follow, help for the love of helping as well as learn for the joy of learning, and utilize advanced skills I don't get to work with all the time.
How do I do all this and more? Naturally, based on whatever is happening at the moment. If I know how to do something or even if I don't I'll figure it out and help others learn it. Then I'll write out the procedure so that everyone can do it especially the non-tech savvy individuals. I can teach anyone just about anything as long as I've done it at least once, it's a passion and a love I believe fits with Wifi Tribe's mission.

I look forward to talking with you more soon.
